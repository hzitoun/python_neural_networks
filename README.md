# Building Python NNs from scratch
Some neural networks I'm building from scratch using Python while learning data science
## Install requirements
First, ensure that you have the latest pip
``` 
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
``` 
If you're using **Anaconda**, then just install mypy (for static typing) `python -m pip install -U mypy` **otherwise**:
``` 
pip install -r requirement.txt
``` 
## Test it
In **samples**, you will get a bunch of pythons programs using the neural nets. So go and run one of them:
``` 
python samples/classifier.py 
```
